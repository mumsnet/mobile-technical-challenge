# Mumsnet Mobile Technical Challenge
We are developing a mobile application that is used to show the Hot threads on Reddit. If a user sees a thread that they want to read, they will be able to tap it to show the full thread, along with the thread's comments.

We will communicate with Reddit through their public API.

For the purposes of this challenge, the mobile application will ultimately be released to both iOS and Android devices.

## Reddit API
The Reddit API documentation can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).

The endpoint for retrieving Hot threads is documented [here](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_hot).

## Considerations
The interface must be smooth. Infinite scrolling through the list of Hot threads should be smooth without any unnecessary wait times.

If there are images in the opening post of the thread they should be displayed in the list, along with the number of comments. Tapping a thread should show the information presented in a way of your choosing.

The structure of the project is up to you, but should be laid out logically.

# Submissions
To submit you challenge, create a new private GitHub repository for your project and push up the code. Document how to get the project up and running both in a simulator and on a test device.

Once you have completed it and would like us to review it, please add the following users to the repo:
